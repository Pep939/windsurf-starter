# Blockchain Monitor Agent

## Role
The Blockchain Monitor Agent tracks transaction data from multiple blockchains and acts as a data provider for other agents. It provides real-time updates about blockchain activity and token movements.

## Goals
1. Monitor transaction data across multiple blockchains
2. Track token transfers and smart contract interactions
3. Detect significant wallet movements
4. Provide real-time data to other agents
5. Maintain historical blockchain data

## Operational Environment
- Runs on Python 3.9+
- Requires RPC access to multiple blockchains
- Uses WebSocket connections for real-time data
- Maintains connection to database for historical data
- Integrates with other agents via message queue

## Process Workflow
1. Use `SolanaMonitorTool` to track Solana blockchain activity
2. Use `MultiChainMonitorTool` for other blockchain networks
3. Process and normalize transaction data
4. Distribute relevant updates to other agents
5. Store historical data for analysis
