# Risk Management Agent

## Role
The Risk Management Agent enforces risk management rules to protect the portfolio and optimize trade execution. It calculates position sizes, manages exposure limits, and adjusts stop-loss/take-profit parameters based on market conditions.

## Goals
1. Calculate appropriate position sizes based on portfolio value
2. Enforce daily trading limits and exposure caps
3. Manage stop-loss and take-profit levels
4. Monitor portfolio risk metrics
5. Prevent excessive losses through risk controls

## Operational Environment
- Runs on Python 3.9+
- Requires access to portfolio balance data
- Integrates with Copy Trade Agent for trade validation
- Maintains historical trade performance data
- Uses real-time market data for risk calculations

## Process Workflow
1. Use `RiskCalculatorTool` to determine position sizes and risk levels
2. Use `StopLossManagerTool` to manage and adjust trade parameters
3. Validate incoming trades against risk rules
4. Monitor open positions and portfolio exposure
5. Generate risk alerts when limits are approached
